                    <p>Bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or coronary revascularization, is a surgical procedure that improves blood flow to the heart by creating a new path for blood to flow around a blocked artery. The procedure involves taking a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body, such as the chest, arm, leg, or belly, and attaching it to the coronary artery above and below the blockage. This new blood vessel is called a graft. The number of grafts needed depends on the severity of the coronary heart disease and how many arteries are blocked</p>

                <p>Urology imaging is a painless way for urologists to examine organs without using radiation or dyes. It provides information about the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, and the male reproductive system. Urology imaging can help diagnose conditions such as organ damage, blockages, tumors, and other abnormalities. It can also help evaluate symptoms like pain, swelling, and infection</p>
